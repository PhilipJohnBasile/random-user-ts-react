FE challenge
Using https://stackblitz.com/ or https://codesandbox.io/​create a React/Typescript application that will load a list of users from this api https://randomuser.me/

Store the result of the request and display the information in a grid of cards styled as seen below.
Include following functionality in the list:
• A search bar that will filter the list based on the user input.
• Should filter by, at minimum first name, last name and email address. Bonus for
filtering by phone number and location.
• Ability to sort the list by any of the fields.
• Ability to edit all the fields, including the photo, and have the card update with
the new information (only in local state not through the api)

You can use any dependencies you like to make it easier to accomplish this task, but we are most interested in your own ability to create UI components, so please refrain from using component libraries such as Material-UI or Ionic. Please ensure it is mobile responsive. Save the project on Stackblitz and share the code link with us as soon as you’re ready.
